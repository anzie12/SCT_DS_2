🚢 Titanic Dataset – EDA & Data Cleaning
This project was completed as Task-2 as a part of my Data Science Internship at Skillcraft Technology.

🧹 Task Overview
Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and trends.

✅ What I Did
- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Dropped the `Cabin` column due to excessive missing data
- Explored survival rates by "passenger class" and "gender" using visualizations

📊 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

🔍 Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive
